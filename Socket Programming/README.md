## SOCKET PROGRAMMING

## What is Socket Programming ?
Socket programming is a technique that enables communication between computers
over a network using sockets, which are endpoints for sending and receiving data.

### Needs of Socket Programming
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket programming is crucial for enabling real-time communication between devices and applications.
- **Client-Server Model**: It allows multiple clients to connect to a server, enabling efficient sharing of resources and data.
- **Cross-Platform**: It works across different platforms and programming languages, making it versatile for diverse applications.

### Socket Programming Working
1. **Socket Creation**: Sockets are created using programming libraries or APIs. They are identified by an IP address and port number.
2. **Server Setup**: In a client-server model, a server socket listens for incoming client connections on a specific port.
3. **Client Connection**: Clients create socket connections to the server's IP address and port.
4. **Data Exchange**: Once connected, data can be sent and received between clients and the server.
5. **Protocols**: Sockets often use protocols like TCP (reliable, connection-oriented) or UDP (fast, connectionless) for data transmission.
6. **Bi-Directional**: Sockets support bidirectional communication, allowing both sending and receiving data simultaneously.

### Applications of Socket Programming
1. **Chat Applications**: Sockets power real-time chat apps like WhatsApp, Slack, and IRC.
2. **Online Gaming**: Multiplayer online games use sockets for real-time player interaction.
3. **Web Applications**: WebSockets enable real-time updates in web applications, such as stock tickers or social media notifications.
4. **Video Streaming**: Sockets are used for live video and audio streaming services.
5. **IoT Devices**: Internet of Things (IoT) devices use sockets to send data to servers or other devices.
6. **Remote Control**: Remote desktops and remote control applications utilise sockets for data transmission.
7. **Network Services**: Network services like FTP, SMTP, and HTTP rely on socket programming for data transfer.
