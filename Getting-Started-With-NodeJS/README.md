# Getting Started with NodeJS
## Introduction to Node.js
### What is Node.js?
1. Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime.
2. It runs on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
3. Node.js enables server-side JavaScript programming.
4. Node.js helps create scalable and high-performance web applications.

Note: Node.js is neither a library nor a framework.

### Why was Node.js created?
1. Node.js was created to overcome the limitations of existing server-side
technologies, such as Apache and PHP, which had issues handling
multiple simultaneous connections.
2. Node.js was a better solution, especially for JavaScript developers.

### How was Node.js created?
Node.js is a server-side runtime for JavaScript created by Ryan Dahl in 2009. His
goal was to develop a fast and efficient platform that could handle the demands of
modern web applications. He used Google's V8 JavaScript engine for its high
performance and paired it with an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model to create a
potent and effective server-side runtime for JavaScript.

### Advantages of using an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model
The main advantage of using an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model is that it
allows for better performance and resource utilization, especially when handling
multiple connections simultaneously.

## Why Is Node.js Popular?
1. High-Performance
2. Role of javascript
3. Lightweight
4. Works well with data-intensive applications

## Runtimes
A runtime is an environment that allows a programming language to execute code. It
provides the necessary resources and tools for a language to interact with the
operating system and hardware. Regarding JavaScript, the browser serves as the
runtime environment, and NodeJS works as runtime on the server.

### What do Runtimes do?
1. Complies or Interprets
2. Memory Management
3. Handles Input/Output Operations
4. Garbage Collection

### Different Browser Runtimes for JavaScript
There are several browser runtimes ( Javascript engine ) for JavaScript, such as V8
for Google Chrome, SpiderMonkey for Mozilla Firefox, Chakra for Microsoft Edge,
and JavaScriptCore for Apple Safari. Each of these engines has its way of
implementing and optimizing JavaScript.

## Setting up Node
### Steps to Install Node.js
1. Go to nodejs.org, the official Node.js website. [Link](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Choose between the LTS (Long Term Support) or the Current version of
Node.js.
3. It is recommended to select the LTS version for better stability, especially for
beginners.
4. Download the LTS installer that matches your operating system.
5. Follow the installation steps.
6. After the installation process, Node.js will be installed and ready to use.
7. To check the Node.js installation, open the terminal/command prompt.
8. Type `node -v` and press enter.
9. The installed version will be displayed.

### Creating and Running the "Hello World" Node.js Program
1. Open a text editor and create a new file named "hello-world.js"
2. Type the following code into the file:
console.log("Hello, World!");
3. Save the file with the .js extension.
4. Open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where the
file is saved.
5. Type node hello-world.js and press enter.
6. The program will execute, and the output "Hello, World!" will be displayed in
the terminal/command prompt.

## Blocking and Non-Blocking Code
***Blocking code***, or synchronous code, is code that stops the execution of your
program until a task is completed. This can cause your application to become
unresponsive, especially when dealing with tasks that take significant time, like
calculations or loops.
Here's an example of blocking code:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
  // This code illustrates a time-consuming task and does not perform any //
  // practical action.
}
console.log('Finished loop.')
```

The code is blocking because it contains a long-running synchronous task.
The program cannot perform other tasks during the execution of the loop, which may
cause it to appear frozen or unresponsive to the user.

***Non-Blocking*** or asynchronous code enables a program to continue execution while
waiting for a task to complete. This is done using callbacks, promises, or async/await
syntax in JavaScript.
Here's an example of non-blocking code:
```javascript
console.log('Starting timer')
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Timer finished.')
}, 5000)
console.log('Finished timer.')
```
In this example, the setTimeout function doesn't block the execution. Instead, it takes
a callback function that gets executed after a specified delay.

## How does NodeJS work?
### Event Loop
The Event Loop is a crucial component of Node.js, responsible for enabling
non-blocking I/O operations in a single-threaded architecture. Essentially, it is a
continuous loop that checks for pending tasks and executes them one by one in the
order they were added to the queue. This process continues until there are no more
tasks left in the queue. By allowing Node.js to perform I/O operations
asynchronously, the Event Loop helps to ensure that the application remains
responsive even when handling a large number of requests.

### I/O Operations
Refer to the tasks that involve reading or writing data to external resources like files,
databases, or network connections. As these operations are generally
time-consuming, Node.js manages them asynchronously to prevent the main thread
from being blocked.

### Handling I/O Operations
1. Node.js uses a combination of the Event Loop, worker threads, and callback
functions to handle I/O operations.
2. When an I/O operation is initiated, Node.js sends the task to a worker thread,
which is separate from the main thread.
3. The worker thread handles the I/O operation in the background, allowing the
main thread to continue executing other tasks.
4. Once the I/O operation is complete, the worker thread adds a callback
function associated with the operation to the Event queue.
5. The Event Loop executes the callback function when it becomes available,
allowing Node.js to handle the result of the I/O operation asynchronously.

### Performance:
Pros
1. Node.js is excellent for I/O-bound operations.
2. Non-blocking, the event-driven architecture enables it to handle many
simultaneous connections.

Cons
1. It may struggle with CPU-bound tasks.
2. Single-threaded execution of JavaScript can cause decreased
performance for complex calculations and data processing

## What is a Server?
### How Web Applications Work?
Web applications follow a client-server architecture, where the client sends requests
to the server. The server processes the request and sends a response back to the
client. This communication between the client and server happens via HTTP
requests and responses.

### Server:
A server is a computer or software that provides resources or services to other
computers over a network. In web applications, servers store and process data,
handle user authentication, and execute server-side code. Servers are responsible
for serving static files to the browser for rendering web pages, as well as receiving
and processing user input to enable dynamic updates on the page.

## Creating an HTTP Server
### What is HTTP?
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a communication protocol used to transmit
and receive data over the Internet. HTTP allows clients (such as web browsers) to send
requests to servers, and servers respond with the requested data.

### Creating a Server
To create a server in Node.js, use the built-in 'http' module.
1. Start by importing it:
```javascript 
const http = require('http')
```
2. Now, create a simple server using the 'http.createServer()' method:
The createServer method creates an HTTP server. It takes a callback function as an
argument that will be called every time a request is made to the server. The callback
function has two arguments: req, which represents the incoming HTTP request, and
res, the HTTP response object we can use to send data back to the client.
```javascript
const server = http.createServer((req, res){
res.end('Hello World!')
});
```
3. Make the server listen on a specific port:
```javascript
const PORT = 3000;
server.listen(PORT)
console.log(`Server is listening at http://localhost:${PORT}`)
```
With this code, we've created a basic server that listens on port 3000 and sends
back a "Hello World!" message for every request.

### Understanding Ports
A port is a unique address that identifies a process or service. Each application has
a unique port number assigned to it. When running multiple servers on a single
computer, using a different port number for each server allows the client to know
which server to communicate with.

### Handling Multiple Requests
1. ```req.url``` is a property of the req (request) object in Node.js.
It contains the URL path of the incoming HTTP request. This includes the portion of the URL after the domain name (e.g., /product, /user, or /).
2. ```res.write()``` -> is a method in Node.js used to send data as part of the HTTP response body.
It allows you to send chunks of data to the client before ending the response with res.end().

## Returning HTML as Response
To return an HTML file, we need to read it using the fs module and then send its
content as a response. Let's create a simple example to demonstrate this.
1. First, create an HTML file named index.html with some primary content.
2. Now, modify the server that serves this file:
  ```javascript
  const http = require('http')
  const fs = require('fs')
  const server = http.createServer((req, res){
    const data = fs.readFileSync('index.html')
    res.end(data)
  })
  server.listen(3100)
  console.log('Server is listening on 3100')
  ```
In this example, we are using the fs.readFileSync method to read the index.html
file, and it can read files and provide content to you
