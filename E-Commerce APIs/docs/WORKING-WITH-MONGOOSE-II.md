## WORKING WITH MONGOOSE-II

## Relationships in Mongoose

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, which allows you
to define data models in a structured manner. Relationships in Mongoose involve
how different data models or collections are related to each other. These
relationships can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many, and they help you
organise and query data effectively.

### Importance of Relationships:

Understanding and implementing relationships in Mongoose is crucial for several
reasons:

1. Efficient Data Organization: Relationships help structure data to reflect
   real-world associations, making data retrieval and management more
   efficient.
2. Data Integrity: Relationships maintain data integrity by ensuring that related
   data remains consistent and accurate.
3. Query Optimization: Properly defined relationships enable you to perform
   complex queries without the need for excessive data manipulation.
4. Improved Application Logic: Relationships allow you to represent complex
   application logic, such as users with multiple blog posts or courses with
   multiple students.

### One to Many Relationships

A one-to-many relationship is a fundamental concept in database modeling where
one entity (document) is associated with multiple related entities in another
collection. In MongoDB, this relationship is often implemented by referencing
documents from one collection in another.

#### Use Case:

You have a web application where you need to define data models for
users. Each user can have multiple blog posts associated with them.

```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String,
  posts: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Post" }],
});
const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);
```

Note:

1. `mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId` is used to represent MongoDB's
   ObjectIds, and `ref: 'Post'` indicates that this field references documents in the 'Post'
   collection.
2. `ref` attribute helps Mongoose understand the relationship between different
   collections and facilitates population and data retrieval across related documents in a
   MongoDB database. It's a way to provide metadata about the relationship between
   fields in different schemas.

### Many-to-One Relationship

A many-to-one relationship occurs when multiple records in one collection are
associated with a single record in another collection. This type of relationship is
commonly used to represent scenarios where multiple entities share a common
parent entity.
Use Case: Consider an e-commerce platform where you have multiple customer
reviews for each product. Each review (many) is associated with a specific product
(one).

```javascript
// Product schema
const productSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  price: Number,
});

// Review schema with a reference to Product
const reviewSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  content: String,
  rating: Number,
  product: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Product" },
});

// Product and Review models
const Product = mongoose.model("Product", productSchema);
const Review = mongoose.model("Review", reviewSchema);
```

### Many to Many Relationships

Many-to-many relationships occur when multiple records in one collection are
associated with multiple records in another collection. In Mongoose, this is
implemented by creating arrays of references to documents from other collections.
For example, in a course management system, a course can have multiple students,
and a student can enrol in multiple courses.

#### Use Case:

You are building a course management system. A course can have multiple students, and a student can enrol in multiple courses.

```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String,
  courses: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Course" }],
});

const courseSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  students: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" }],
});

const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);
const Course = mongoose.model("Course", courseSchema);
```

## Implement One-to-Many relationship: each Product can have multiple Reviews

### 1. Created 'review.schema.js' file

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";

export const reviewSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  product: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: "Product",
  },
  user: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: "User",
  },
  rating: Number,
});
```

This `reviewSchema` defines a Mongoose schema for storing product reviews in a MongoDB database.

1. üì¶ reviewSchema Structure:
   - `mongoose.Schema(...)`: Creates a new schema object for the `Review` collection.
   - `export`: Makes it available for use in other files.
2. üõçÔ∏è product Field:
   - `type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId`: This means `product` stores a reference (ID) to another MongoDB document.
   - `ref: "Product"`: Tells Mongoose this ObjectId refers to the Product collection.
   - üîó This creates a relationship (foreign key-like) to a Product document.
3. üë§ user Field:
   - Stores the ID of the user who gave the review.
   - `ref: "User"` creates a link to the User document.
4. ‚≠ê rating Field:
   - A number field representing how many stars (e.g., 1‚Äì5) the user gave the product.
   - You can later add validation here (e.g., min 1, max 5) if needed.

This schema enables storing **which user reviewed which product and what rating they gave**, while maintaining proper references for to **populate full user and product details** when needed.

### 2. Updated 'product.schema.js' file

#### ‚úÖ Before (Old Code):

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";

export const productSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  description: String,
  price: Number,
  category: String,
  inStock: Number,
});
```

#### üîÅ After (Updated Code):

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";

export const productSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  desc: String,
  price: Number,
  imageUrl: String,
  category: String,
  sizes: [String],
  stock: Number,
  reviews: [
    {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "Review",
    },
  ],
});
```

The updated schema now includes:

1. `imageUrl: String` ‚Äì Stores the product's image URL.
2. `sizes: [String]` ‚Äì Holds an array of available sizes for the product (e.g. ["S", "M", "L"]).
3. `stock: Number` ‚Äì Renamed from inStock to reflect the product's available stock.
4. `desc: String` ‚Äì Renamed from description to reflect a more concise representation of the product‚Äôs details.
5. `reviews: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Review" }]`
   - This line adds a new `reviews` field to the product schema. It is an array of references (ObjectIds) that point to documents in the `Review` collection.
   - This setup establishes a **relationship between a product and its reviews**, allowing each product to store multiple associated review IDs.
   - By using the `ref: "Review"` option, you enable Mongoose population, which means:
     - You can easily fetch full review details (like rating, reviewer, etc.) along with the product,
     - Instead of just storing raw data, you link documents across collections, keeping your database normalized and efficient.

These changes provide a richer structure for representing a product, including its image, ratings, and available sizes, while maintaining relationships with reviews.

### 3. 'product.repository.js' file

Moved existing code from user.repository.js to user.repository_old.js, and updated code to a fresh user.repository.js file

#### üîÅ 1. Shift from Embedded Ratings to Review Collection

Earlier:

```javascript
ratings: [{ userID, rating }];
```

Stored ratings directly inside the product document, making it harder to manage detailed review data, such as timestamps, comments, etc.

Now:

```javascript
reviews: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Review" }];
```

- Ratings are stored in a separate Review model.
- Each review references both the product and the user.
- Allows for more scalable, normalized data (follows MongoDB best practices).

#### üèóÔ∏è 2. Integration of Mongoose Models

‚úÖ Added at the top:

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import { productSchema } from "./product.schema.js";
import { reviewSchema } from "./review.schema.js";

const ProductModel = mongoose.model("Product", productSchema);
const ReviewModel = mongoose.model("Review", reviewSchema);
```

‚ûï Purpose:

- ProductModel is now used to verify if a product exists before rating.
- ReviewModel is now used to create or update user ratings in a separate reviews collection.

This adds:

- Schema validation
- Relationship modeling
- Cleaner separation of concerns

#### üîÅ 3. Updated rate Method Logic

```javascript
async rate(userID, productID, rating) {
    try {
      // 1. Check if product exists
      const productToUpdate = await ProductModel.findById(productID);
      if (!productToUpdate) {
        throw new Error("Product not found !");
      }

      let review;
      const existingReview = await ReviewModel.findOne({
        product: new ObjectId(productID),
        user: new ObjectId(userID),
      });

      if (existingReview) {
        existingReview.rating = rating;
        await existingReview.save();
        review = existingReview;
      } else {
        const newReview = new ReviewModel({
          product: new ObjectId(productID),
          user: new ObjectId(userID),
          rating: rating,
        });
        await newReview.save();
        review = newReview;
      }

      // 3. Update the product's reviews array
      await ProductModel.findByIdAndUpdate(productID, {
        $addToSet: { reviews: review._id }, // $addToSet prevents duplicates
      });
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
      throw new ApplicationError("Something went wrong with database", 500);
    }
  }
```

This function is designed to handle a product rating (or review) by a user.

1. Check Product Existence:
   - `ProductModel.findById(productID)` is used to check if the product exists in the database.
   - If the product isn‚Äôt found, it throws an error.
2. Handle Existing Review:
   - `ReviewModel.findOne()` is used to find an existing review for the product by the user.
   - If found, the review‚Äôs `rating` is updated and saved with `existingReview.save()`.
   - If not found, a new review is created using `new ReviewModel()` and saved with `newReview.save()`.
3. Update Product‚Äôs Review List:
   - `ProductModel.findByIdAndUpdate()` is used to update the product‚Äôs review array.
   - The `$addToSet` operator ensures that the review‚Äôs ID is added without duplicates.
4. Error Handling:
   - If any error occurs during the database operations, it‚Äôs caught in the `catch` block.
   - A custom error is thrown using `ApplicationError` to notify the user of database issues.

This function effectively interacts with the database to check product existence, manage reviews, and update the product's review list.

#### üîç Comparison: `findById()` vs `findOne()` vs `findByIdAndUpdate()` in Mongoose

1. `findById(id)`
   - Use: Fetches a single document using its `_id` field.
   ```javascript
   const productToUpdate = await ProductModel.findById(productID);
   ```
   - Purpose here: To check whether the product exists before proceeding.
2. `findOne(filter)`

   - Use: Finds a single document that matches the specified filter/criteria.

   ```javascript
   const existingReview = await ReviewModel.findOne({
     product: new ObjectId(productID),
     user: new ObjectId(userID),
   });
   ```

   - Purpose here: To check if the user has already submitted a review for the product.

3. `findByIdAndUpdate(id, update, options?)`
   - Use: Finds a document by `_id` and applies the given update. You can optionally return the updated document or apply other options.
   ```javascript
   await ProductModel.findByIdAndUpdate(productID, {
     $addToSet: { reviews: review._id },
   });
   ```
   - Purpose here: To add the review's ID to the product's `reviews` array, ensuring no duplicates (thanks to `$addToSet`).

### 4. Testing in Postman

#### Rating added by multiple Users, on the same product

#### One-to-Many Relationship: A Single Product with Multiple Reviews

<img src="./images/reviews_collection.png" alt="Reviews Collection" width="700" height="auto">

<img src="./images/addedReviews_OnProduct.png" alt="Reviews added on Product" width="700" height="auto">

## Many-to-Many Relationship: Products can belong to multiple Categories and vice versa

### 1. Created 'category.schema.js' file

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";

export const categorySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  products: [
    {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "Product",
    },
  ],
});
```

Defines a Mongoose schema for categories, each having a name and a list of associated product references.

1. Imports Mongoose to work with MongoDB in a structured way.
2. Defines and exports a `categorySchema` using `mongoose.Schema`.
3. The schema has two fields:
   - `name`: A string representing the category name (e.g., "Books", "Clothing").
   - `products`: An array of ObjectIds that reference documents in the `Product` collection.
4. Each ObjectId in `products` uses: - `type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId` ‚Äì to store MongoDB reference IDs. - `ref: "Product"` ‚Äì to link it to the Product model for population.
   Enables relationships between categories and their products using Mongoose‚Äôs population feature.

### 2. Updated 'product.schema.js' file

#### ‚úÖ Before (Old Code):

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";

export const productSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  desc: String,
  price: Number,
  imageUrl: String,
  category: String,
  sizes: [String],
  stock: Number,
  reviews: [
    {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "Review",
    },
  ],
});
```

#### üîÅ After (Updated Code):

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";

export const productSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  desc: String,
  price: Number,
  imageUrl: String,
  sizes: [String],
  stock: Number,
  reviews: [
    {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "Review",
    },
  ],
  categories: [
    {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "Category",
    },
  ],
});
```

Explanation of the updated part of the code:

1. Removed: `category: String`
   - This field for a single category was removed.
2. Added: `categories: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Category" }]`
   - Products can now belong to multiple categories.
   - Each category is represented by an ObjectId referencing the `Category` collection.
   - `ref: "Category"` links these ObjectIds to the `Category` model for easy population of category details.

### 3. Updated 'mongooseConfig.js' file

#### ‚úÖ Before (Old Code):

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();

const url = process.env.DB_URL;
export const connectUsingMongoose = async () => {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect(url);
    console.log("MongoDB connected using Mongoose !");
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Error while connecting to db !");
    console.log(err);
  }
};
```

#### üîÅ After (Updated Code):

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import { categorySchema } from "../src/features/product/category.schema.js";
dotenv.config();

const url = process.env.DB_URL;
export const connectUsingMongoose = async () => {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect(url);
    console.log("MongoDB connected using Mongoose !");
    addCategories();
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Error while connecting to db !");
    console.log(err);
  }
};

async function addCategories() {
  const CategoryModel = mongoose.model("Category", categorySchema);
  const categories = await CategoryModel.find();
  if (!categories || categories.length == 0) {
    await CategoryModel.insertMany([
      { name: "Geography" },
      { name: "Global Politics" },
      { name: "Map" },
      { name: "Non-Fiction" },
      { name: "Science" },
      { name: "Physics" },
      { name: "Genetics" },
      { name: "Computers" },
      { name: "Software Development" },
      { name: "Programming" },
      { name: "Articial Intelligence" },
      { name: "Technology" },
    ]);
  }
  console.log("Categories are added !");
}
```

Explanation of the updated part of the code:

- **Added `addCategories` function:**
  - The function is called after successfully connecting to the database (`addCategories()`).
  - It checks whether the `Category` collection already contains any categories:
  - If no categories exist (`if (!categories || categories.length == 0)`), it inserts a predefined list of categories using `CategoryModel.insertMany()`.
  - The categories include topics like "Geography", "Science", "Programming", etc.
- **Purpose:**
  - Automatic category creation: Ensures that default categories are added to the database when the connection is successful and if no categories are already present.
  - Database initialization: Helps initialize the `Category` collection with standard categories.
- **Why it's useful:**
  - It ensures the application has a set of default categories for future products to be associated with.
  - Provides a mechanism to populate the `Category` collection automatically if it‚Äôs empty, improving the system setup.

### 4. Updated 'product.controller.js' file

#### ‚úÖ Before (Old Code):

```javascript
async addProduct(req, res) {
  try {
    const { name, desc, price, imageUrl, category, sizes } = req.body;

    const newProduct = new ProductModel(
      name,
      desc || "No description available",
      parseFloat(price),
      req.file ? req.file.filename : imageUrl,
      category || "Uncategorized",
      Array.isArray(sizes)
        ? sizes
        : typeof sizes === "string"
        ? sizes.split(",")
        : []
    );

    const createdProduct = await this.productRepository.add(newProduct);
    res.status(201).send(createdProduct);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    return res.status(500).send("Something went wrong");
  }
}
```

#### üîÅ After (Updated Code):

```javascript
async addProduct(req, res) {
  try {
    const { name, desc, price, imageUrl, categories, sizes } = req.body;

    // Convert 'categories' to array if string, else keep it as array
    const categoriesArray =
      typeof categories === "string"
        ? categories.split(",").map((c) => c.trim())
        : Array.isArray(categories)
        ? categories.map((c) => c.trim())
        : [];

    // Convert 'sizes' to array if string, else keep it as array
    const sizesArray = Array.isArray(sizes)
      ? sizes
      : typeof sizes === "string"
      ? sizes.split(",")
      : [];

    const newProduct = new ProductModel(
      name,
      desc || "No description available",
      parseFloat(price),
      req.file ? req.file.filename : imageUrl,
      categoriesArray,
      sizesArray
    );

    const createdProduct = await this.productRepository.add(newProduct);
    res.status(201).send(createdProduct);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    return res.status(500).send("Something went wrong");
  }
}
```

`addProduct` Method Update:

1. Changed `category` to `categories`:
   - This handles multiple categories as an array or comma-separated string sent in the request body (`req.body.categories`).
2. Updated `categoriesArray`:
   - If `categories` is a string, it is split into an array and each category is trimmed.
   - If `categories` is already an array, it is mapped to remove extra spaces.
3. Updated `sizesArray`:
   - Similar logic applied to `sizes` to ensure that it's either a string split into an array or left as-is if it‚Äôs already an array.

These changes ensure that you can handle multiple categories and sizes correctly when adding a product.

### 5. Updated 'product.model.js' file

Moved existing code from product.model.js to product.model_old.js, and added updated code to a fresh product.model.js file:

```javascript
export default class ProductModel {
  constructor(name, desc, price, imageUrl, categories, sizes, id) {
    this._id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.desc = desc;
    this.price = price;
    this.imageUrl = imageUrl;
    this.categories = categories;
    this.sizes = sizes;
  }
}
```

- Renaming `category` to `categories`: The constructor now accepts `categories` as an array instead of a single string. This allows a product to belong to multiple categories, which makes the model more flexible. The `category` property was replaced because a product may fit into multiple categories (e.g., "Science" and "Geography"), and this change accommodates that.
- The rest of the fields remain the same to maintain existing functionality.

### 6. Updated 'product.repository.js' file

#### üèóÔ∏è 1. Created Mongoose Models

‚úÖ Added at the top:

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import { productSchema } from "./product.schema.js";
import { reviewSchema } from "./review.schema.js";
import { categorySchema } from "./category.schema.js";

const ProductModel = mongoose.model("Product", productSchema);
const ReviewModel = mongoose.model("Review", reviewSchema);
const CategoryModel = mongoose.model("Category", categorySchema);
```

In the updated code, only `CategoryModel` is newly added, while ProductModel and ReviewModel remain unchanged.

- `ProductModel` and `ReviewModel` represent the `Product` and `Review` collections, respectively, providing methods for querying and updating MongoDB.
- `CategoryModel` is newly introduced to interact with the `Category` collection. It is used to update the relevant categories by adding the new product's ID to the `products` array in the categories.

#### üîÅ 2. Updated add Method Logic

```javascript
async add(productData) {
  try {
    // 1. Add the product.
    const newProduct = new ProductModel(productData);
    console.log(newProduct); // Log the Mongoose Model instance
    const savedProduct = await newProduct.save();

    // 2. Update Categories.
    await CategoryModel.updateMany(
      {
        _id: { $in: productData.categories },
      },
      {
        $push: { products: new ObjectId(savedProduct._id) },
      }
    );
    return savedProduct;
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    throw new ApplicationError("Something went wrong with Data", 500);
  }
}
```

This code defines an add method that creates a new product, saves it to the database, and updates the related categories with the new product's ID.

1. Creating a New Product Instance:
   - The line `const newProduct = new ProductModel(productData);` creates a new product instance using the `ProductModel` and the data passed in `productData`. This product is created but not yet saved to the database.
   - `ProductModel(productData)`: This is a Mongoose model constructor that uses the schema to validate and create a new product object.
2. Saving the Product to MongoDB:
   - `const savedProduct = await newProduct.save();` saves the newly created product to the MongoDB database. The `.save()` method automatically handles validation (if defined) and assigns an `_id` to the new product.
   - `newProduct.save()`: This persists the document and returns the saved document.
3. Updating Categories:
   - After the product is saved, we update the related categories using `CategoryModel.updateMany()`. This method performs a bulk update on all categories that are associated with the product.
   - CategoryModel.updateMany():
     - `{$in: productData.categories}`: This checks that the category IDs from `productData.categories` match any category in the database.
     - `$push: { products: new ObjectId(savedProduct._id) }`: This adds the product's `_id` to the `products` array of each matching category.

This ensures that the product is saved in the database, and related categories are updated accordingly.

### 7. Testing in Postman

## Multiple References

In some cases, you may need to reference the same model multiple times within a
single schema. For instance, in a social networking application, users can have
multiple types of connections, such as friends and mentors, both of which are also
users of the application. Multiple references allow you to establish different types of
relationships with the same model.

#### Use Case:

In a social networking application, users can have friends and mentors who are also users of the application.

```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  friends: [
    {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "User",
    },
  ],
  mentors: [
    {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "User",
    },
  ],
});

const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);
```

## Create 'Like' Feature

### 1. Created 'like.schema.js' file

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";

export const likeSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  user: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: "User",
  },
  likeable: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    refPath: "types",
  },
  types: {
    type: String,
    enum: ["Product", "Category"],
  },
});
```

This Mongoose schema defines a "Like" system, where a user can like different types of entities ~ specifically a Product or a Category. It uses a polymorphic reference (refPath) to dynamically link to different models based on the liked item's type

1. üßë‚Äçüíª `user`
   - Type: `mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId`
   - Ref: `"User"`
   - Purpose: Stores the ID of the user who performed the like.
   - Function: Establishes a relationship with the User model, enabling population of user details later.
2. ‚ù§Ô∏è `likeable`
   - Type: `mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId`
   - RefPath: `"types"`
   - Purpose: Holds the ID of the liked entity (can be either a Product or a Category).
   - Function: Dynamically references the model defined in the `types` field using Mongoose‚Äôs `refPath`.
3. üè∑Ô∏è `types`
   - Type: `String`
   - Enum: `["Product", "Category"]`
   - Purpose: Specifies the type of the liked item.
   - Function: Used by `refPath` to determine whether the liked item is from the `Product` or `Category` model.

This schema provides a **flexible and scalable way** to handle likes on multiple types of items using \***\*polymorphic references**. Instead of creating separate like schemas for each model, this single schema efficiently supports likes on both `Product` and `Category` entities.

### 2. Created 'like.controller.js' file

```javascript
import { LikeRepository } from "./like.repository.js";

export class LikeController {
  constructor() {
    this.likeRepository = new LikeRepository();
  }

  async likeItem(req, res, next) {
    try {
      const { id, type } = req.body;
      const userId = req.userID;
      if (type != "Product" && type != "Category") {
        return res.status(400).send("Invalid Type !");
      }
      if (type == "Product") {
        this.likeRepository.likeProduct(userId, id);
      } else {
        this.likeRepository.likeCategory(userId, id);
      }
      return res.status(200).send(`${type} liked successfully !`);
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
      return res.status(500).send("Something went wrong");
    }
  }

  async getLikes(req, res, next) {
    try {
      const { id, type } = req.query;
      const likes = await this.likeRepository.getLikes(type, id);
      return res.status(200).send(likes);
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
      return res.status(500).send("Something went wrong");
    }
  }
}
```

The `LikeController` class is part of a typical MVC (Model-View-Controller) backend architecture. It handles HTTP requests related to liking items (either a Product or Category) and retrieving likes.

It uses a separate `LikeRepository` to handle database operations, keeping the controller clean and focused on handling requests/responses.

1. üß± Structure Overview
   - The controller begins by importing the `LikeRepository`, which is responsible for handling all database operations related to likes.
   - A class named `LikeController` is defined and exported. Inside its constructor, it creates an instance of the `LikeRepository`. This allows the controller to use repository methods to perform database actions like liking items or fetching likes.
2. Method `likeItem(req, res, next)` : Handles liking a Product or Category.
   - Input:
     - `req.body` should include:
       - `id:` ID of the item to be liked
       - `type:` either `"Product"` or `"Category"`
     - `req.userID`: ID of the user performing the like (likely set via authentication middleware)
   - Steps:
     - Validates the type ‚Äî if it's not "Product" or "Category", sends a 400 Bad Request.
     - Based on the type, calls the appropriate method:
       - `likeProduct(userId, id)`
       - `likeCategory(userId, id)`
     - Sends a 200 response confirming the specified item type was liked successfully.
   - Error Handling:
     - Logs any unexpected errors and returns 500 Internal Server Error.
3. Method `getLikes(req, res, next)`: Fetches likes for a specific item (Product or Category).
   - Input:
     - `req.query` should include:
       - `id`: ID of the item
       - `type`: either `"Product"` or `"Category"`
   - Steps:
     - Calls `getLikes(type, id)` from the repository.
     - Returns the list of likes with 200 OK.
   - Error Handling:
     - Logs errors and sends a 500 response if something fails.

The `LikeController` manages user like actions and retrieves like data efficiently. It ensures clean separation of logic by delegating database tasks to the `LikeRepository`.

### 3. Created 'like.repository.js' file

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import { ObjectId } from "mongodb";
import { likeSchema } from "./like.schema.js";

const LikeModel = mongoose.model("Like", likeSchema);
export class LikeRepository {
  async getLikes(type, id) {
    return await LikeModel.find({
      likeable: new ObjectId(id),
      types: type,
    })
      .populate("user")
      .populate({ path: "likeable", model: type });
  }

  async likeProduct(userId, productId) {
    try {
      const newLike = new LikeModel({
        user: new ObjectId(userId),
        likeable: new ObjectId(productId),
        types: "Product",
      });
      await newLike.save();
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
      throw new ApplicationError("Something went wrong with Database", 500);
    }
  }

  async likeCategory(userId, categoryId) {
    try {
      const newLike = new LikeModel({
        user: new ObjectId(userId),
        likeable: new ObjectId(categoryId),
        types: "Category",
      });
      await newLike.save();
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
      throw new ApplicationError("Something went wrong with Database", 500);
    }
  }
}
```

The `LikeRepository` class is part of the **data access layer**. It handles **database operations** for the Like system using Mongoose and MongoDB, including storing likes and retrieving them.

1. üß± Structure Overview
   - Imports:
     - `mongoose` for defining and working with MongoDB models.
     - `ObjectId` from MongoDB to correctly format object IDs.
     - `likeSchema` which defines the structure for like documents.
   - Creates a `LikeModel` using the `likeSchema`.
2. Method `getLikes(type, id)`
   - Purpose: Fetches all likes for a given item (Product or Category).
   - Steps:
     - Finds documents in the "Like" collection where:
       - likeable matches the given item ID.
       - types matches the item type (Product/Category).
     - Populates the user field to return full user details.
     - Dynamically populates the likeable field based on the type value.
   - Returns: An array of like documents with populated user and likeable data.
3. Method `likeProduct(userId, productId)`
   - Purpose: Saves a new like for a Product.
   - Steps:
     - Creates a new document with:
       - `user`: the user ID
       - `likeable:` the product ID
       - `types`: set to `"Product"`
     - Saves it to the database.
   - Error Handling:
     - Logs the error and throws a custom `ApplicationError`.
4. Method `likeCategory(userId, categoryId)`
   - Purpose: Saves a new like for a Category.
   - Same logic as `likeProduct`, but sets `types` to `"Category"`.

The `LikeRepository` handles the creation and retrieval of like records in a clean, modular way. It supports polymorphic references and uses best practices like dynamic population and centralized error handling.

4. Created 'like.routes.js' file

```javascript
import express from "express";
import { LikeController } from "./like.controller.js";

const likeRouter = express.Router();

const likeController = new LikeController();

likeRouter.post("/", (req, res, next) => {
  likeController.likeItem(req, res, next);
});

likeRouter.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  likeController.getLikes(req, res, next);
});

export default likeRouter;
```

This code defines an Express router named likeRouter to handle HTTP requests related to the "Like" feature. It connects incoming requests to the appropriate methods in the LikeController.

1. üß± Structure Overview
   - Imports:
     - express: To create the router.
     - LikeController: The controller containing the business logic for handling likes.
   - Router Initialization:
     - likeRouter is created using express.Router() to define route-specific middleware and handlers.
     - An instance of LikeController is created to access its methods.
2. ‚úÖ Routes Defined
   - POST `/`
     - Handler: `likeController.likeItem(req, res, next)`
     - Purpose: Allows a user to like a Product or Category.
     - Request Type: POST
     - Input Expected: In the body ‚Äì item `id` and `type` (Product or Category).
   - GET `/`
     - Handler: `likeController.getLikes(req, res, next)`
     - Purpose: Retrieves all likes for a specific Product or Category.
     - Request Type: GET
     - Input Expected: In the query ‚Äì item `id` and `type`.

The `likeRouter` sets up the API endpoints for liking items and retrieving likes, and routes the requests to the appropriate controller methods, maintaining a clean separation of concerns in the application's architecture.

### 5. Updated 'server.js' file

The updated code added Like API support to the main server file.

1. Imported Like Router

```javascript
import likeRouter from "./src/features/like/like.routes.js";
```

This imports the router that handles Like-related routes such as liking products or categories and fetching likes.

2. Registered Like Route in Express

```javascript
server.use("/api/likes", jwtAuth, likeRouter);
```

- This line mounts the `likeRouter` under the `/api/likes` path.
- It is protected by `jwtAuth`, so only authenticated users can access like APIs.

This update completes the integration of the Like feature, maintaining consistent security, structure, and modularity across the API.

## Mongoose Middleware

Mongoose middleware are functions that can be executed before or after certain
operations on documents, such as saving, updating, or removing. These middleware
functions enable you to add custom logic or perform actions before or after database
operations. For example, you can use middleware to automatically update
timestamps or perform data validation.

#### Use Cases:

1. You want to automatically update the "lastUpdated" field of a document every
   time it is modified.

```javascript
userSchema.pre("save", function (next) {
  this.lastUpdated = new Date();
  next();
});
```

2. You want to delete all related comments after removing a blog post.

```javascript
postSchema.pre("remove", async function (next) {
  await Comment.deleteMany({ postId: this._id });
  next();
});
```

### 1. Updated 'like.schema.js' file

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";

export const likeSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  user: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: "User",
  },
  likeable: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    refPath: "types",
  },
  types: {
    type: String,
    enum: ["Product", "Category"],
  },
})
  .pre("save", (next) => {
    console.log("New like coming in...");
    next();
  })
  .post("save", (docs) => {
    console.log("Like is saved !");
    console.log(docs);
  })
  .pre("find", (next) => {
    console.log("Retrieving likes...");
    next();
  })
  .post("find", (docs) => {
    console.log("Find is completed !");
    console.log(docs);
  });
```

The updated part of the code enhances the likeSchema by adding Mongoose middleware hooks (pre and post) to log key operations for debugging and monitoring:

1. `pre("save")` Hook:
   - Executes before a like is saved to the database.
   - Logs `"New like coming in..."` to indicate an incoming like action.
2. `post("save")` Hook:
   - Executes after a like is successfully saved.
   - Logs `"Like is saved !"` and the saved document (`docs`) for confirmation.
3. `pre("find")` Hook:
   - Executes before a find operation (e.g., when fetching likes).
   - Logs `"Retrieving likes..."` to track database read operations.
4. `post("find")` Hook:
   - Executes after likes are retrieved from the database.
   - Logs `"Find is completed !"` and the result documents (docs).

These hooks help in tracing application behavior and are useful for debugging and auditing like-related operations.

## Best Practices for Databases

When working with databases, it's essential to follow best practices to ensure data
consistency, performance, and reliability. Some standard best practices include
indexing frequently queried fields for faster retrieval, implementing data validation to maintain data integrity, considering sharding to scale horizontally for large datasets,
and having backup and recovery plans to protect against data loss.

### 1. Schema Design

Schema design is a critical aspect of database development that involves defining
the structure of your database documents. A well-designed schema can improve
database efficiency and maintainability.

- **Normalisation vs. Denormalization**: Consider the trade-off between normalising
  data (minimising redundancy) and denormalising (embedding related data) based on
  your application's read and write patterns.
- **Use of Embedded Documents**: Embed related data within a document when it
  makes sense for your queries, reducing the need for complex joins.
- **Avoid Deep Nesting**: Excessive nesting of documents can lead to complex queries
  and impact performance. Strike a balance between embedding and referencing data

### 2. Indexing

Indexing is crucial for optimising query performance by allowing the database to
quickly locate and retrieve data.

- **Identify Query Patterns**: Understand the types of queries your application performs
  frequently to determine which fields should be indexed.
- **Avoid Over-Indexing**: Indexing every field can increase storage space and slow
  down write operations. Choose indexes judiciously.
- **Use Compound Indexes**: Combine multiple fields into a single index to support
  queries that filter on multiple criteria.
- **Monitor Index Performance**: Regularly analyse and optimise your indexes to
  ensure they align with your application's needs.

### 3. Error Handling

Proper error handling ensures your application can gracefully handle unexpected
situations and provide meaningful feedback to users.

- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Wrap database operations in try-catch blocks to catch and
  handle errors effectively.
- **Custom Error Messages**: Provide clear and informative error messages that assist
  developers in diagnosing issues quickly.
- **Centralised Error Handling**: Implement centralised error-handling mechanisms or
  middleware to avoid duplicating error-handling code throughout your application.
- **Logging**: Implement robust logging mechanisms to record errors and application
  events for debugging and monitoring purposes.

### 4. Validations

Data validation is essential for maintaining data integrity and preventing invalid or
malicious data from entering your database.

- **Schema-Level Validation**: Define validation rules at the schema level using
  Mongoose or other validation libraries to check data before it is saved.
- **Built-in Validators**: Utilize built-in validation options provided by Mongoose, such as
  required, min, max, and enum, to validate data quickly.
- **Custom Validators**: Create custom validation functions for complex validation
  requirements that cannot be handled by built-in validators.
- **Sanitisation**: Implement data sanitisation techniques to clean and validate user
  input, protecting against malicious data.

These best practices are fundamental to building efficient, robust, and secure
MongoDB applications. They help you create a solid foundation for your database
systems and ensure data consistency and reliability.
