## TASK-RUNNERS IN NODEJS

## TaskRunner

- A TaskRunner is a software component or tool designed to manage and execute
  tasks or jobs in a systematic and organized manner.
- It plays a crucial role in automating and streamlining various processes, making it an
  essential part of many applications and systems.

### Need of TaskRunner

1. **Task Management**: Organizes and executes tasks systematically.
2. **Automation**: Reduces manual effort by automating repetitive tasks.
3. **Parallel Processing**: Enhances efficiency by executing tasks in parallel.
4. **Dependency Resolution**: Ensures tasks run when prerequisites are met.
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Tracks task progress and logs status.
6. **Scalability**: Handles tasks across multiple servers for scalability.

### How it Works:

1. **Task Definition**: Tasks are defined with attributes like name, code, and
   dependencies.
2. **Task Queue**: Tasks are added to a queue for execution.
3. **Scheduling**: Tasks are scheduled based on dependencies and priority.
4. **Execution**: Tasks are executed, and results are monitored.
5. **Logging**: Task execution details and errors are logged.
6. **Notification**: Alerts can be sent upon completion or specific events.
7. **Scaling**: Distributes tasks across multiple servers as needed.

### Applications:

1. **Batch Processing**: Used for processing large volumes of data, such as data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs and image processing.
2. **Workflow Automation**: TaskRunners automate workflows in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and manufacturing, to improve efficiency.
3. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: They are integral to CI/CD pipelines, running tests, building and deploying code automatically.
4. **Server Maintenance**: TaskRunners help manage server maintenance tasks like backups, software updates, and security scans.
5. **Job Schedulers**: In operating systems, they serve as job schedulers to manage system-level tasks and user-defined scripts.
6. **Data Pipelines**: TaskRunners are used in creating and managing data pipelines for data analysis and reporting.
7. **IoT Device Management**: TaskRunners can manage and update software on IoT devices.
8. **Content Publishing**: For blogs and websites, they can automate content publishing and updates.
9. **Game Servers**: In online gaming, TaskRunners can manage game server instances and matchmakings.

## Grunt Setup

Grunt is a popular JavaScript task runner that automates repetitive tasks in web development.

### Installation:

To install Grunt, follow these steps:

- Install Node.js if not already installed. Grunt runs on Node.js.
- Install Grunt's command-line interface (CLI) globally using npm (Node Package Manager) with the following command:

  ```sh
  npm install -g grunt-cli
  ```

### Gruntfile Setup:

The Gruntfile is a configuration file used to define and configure tasks in Grunt.

#### Steps:

1. Create a Grunt Project Directory:
   - Start by creating a new directory for your Grunt project.
   - Open your command line or terminal and navigate to this directory.
2. Initialize a Node.js Project:
   - Run the following command to create a package.json file, which stores project metadata and dependencies:
     ```sh
     npm init
     ```
3. Install Grunt Locally:
   - Install Grunt as a project dependency in the project directory using npm. This
     allows you to manage Grunt versions specific to your project:
     ```sh
     npm install grunt --save-dev
     ```
4. Create a Gruntfile:
   - Create a JavaScript file named "Gruntfile.js" in your project directory. This is
     where you define your Grunt tasks and configuration.
